# Kata.ai Junior Frontend Programmer Test

Welcome to the Kata.ai Junior Frontend Programmer Test! Before you proceed any further in your application, you must complete this test first.

This is a basic Next.js project, complete with a sample app, TypeScript, and a simple REST API baked in using [Next.js' API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). It includes our [design system components](https://github.com/kata-ai/aksara-ui) `@aksara-ui/core`, and the project structure closely mimics what we normally do in our frontend stack.

## Question

"My code won't run and the tests fail. Could you help me fix it?"

Your colleague comes into your desk and asks for help with the code they're writing, mentioning that there are some type errors and failing tests. Nobody else in your team seems to be around, so you agreed to take a look into the code and help them fix it. Could you find the issue and help them fix it?

## Notes

- The TypeScript interfaces/types are assumed correct. You shouldn't change them.
- The tests are assumed correct. You shouldn't change them.
- Do not change the data returned from the API pages.

## Getting Started

A nodejs >= 10.0.0 setup with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended.

First we install the required dependencies by running `yarn`.

```bash
yarn
```

Then we can run the server locally. Since Next.js comes with TypeScript built-in, the project won't run locally if there are any type errors.

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev
```

To validate types and lint the project, run:

```bash
yarn validate
```

To run unit tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```
